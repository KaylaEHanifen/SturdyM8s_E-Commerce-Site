# This-Shop-Rocks
Welcome to the Sturdy M8's Emporium—a hub for unconventional companionship! This repository showcases my capstone project: an HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap e-commerce site selling pet rocks as humanities fill-in for companionship; requiring no effort but delivering all the benefits of an authentic, lasting relationship for the incapable/unwilling. Explore the future of one-sided friendships—because if you can't beat it, join it right? Venture into the codebase for a journey through the ordinary, with a twist!
